# NMSLMP_LivDet2021

In this repository, you can find the MATLAB code used to generate the console application that was submitted for the LivDet 2021 competition.

The console application is functional for both challenges and must be used according to the description of the website: https://livdet.diee.unica.it/index.php/home/algorithm-specifications. The main function of this application if "BoavContNonVia_NMSLMP.m", the console application was made using this function as "main".

The .dat files are the NMSLMP features extracted from the fingerprint bases made available for training by the competition. These images were collected using three different sensors: GreenBit, DigitalPersona, and Dermalog, as specified on the competition website.


The arXiv link of the paper describing the NMSLMP algorithm and its gains compared to other techniques will be placed in this repository shortly. The same text must be sent for review at events and periodicals in the area.
